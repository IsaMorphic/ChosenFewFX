Before proceeding be aware that it is up to you to find your program's OFX plugin folder.  
We highly recommend that you look up the proper directory for your program if you are unsure.
We have the proper location for VEGAS Pro 14 displayed in the installation directory picker on the next screen as an example.
If VEGAS Pro 14 is indeed your program, there is no need to change it.  We are not responsible for any mistakes you make as an end user.
In the future, this installer will contain several more examples on this page for other programs. But for now, it is what it is.
Thanks for reading,
